### Types of contributions


-   Bug reports.
-   Compatibility patches (support for different `C++` compilers).
-   Minor patches (documentation clarification and typos;
    code/documentation formatting; naming convention amendments).
-   Functionality updates.
-   Testing (testing or demo scripts for existing functionality).
-   Re-implementations (performance improvements; system/language support
    extensions).
-   Anything else, as long as its utility and functionality is described.

### Bug reports


Please [open a new issue][github-new-issue] for each unreported bug.
Specify "[BUG] *1-sentence-description-of-bug*" as the issue title, and
list the following information in the issue body:

-   Brief summary and background.
-   Bug description: what should happen, and what happens instead.
-   Version of compiler, operating system, and relevant libraries.
-   Code for a concise script that reproduces and illustrates the
    bug.
-   Any other relevant notes (e.g., what you think causes the bug, any
    steps you may have taken to identify or resolve it, etc).

### Pull requests


Please submit a [pull request][github-pull-request] for each code or
documentation contribution to SG-t-SNE-Π.  When submitting a pull request, please
adhere to the following.

-   Clearly identify the [type of your contribution](#contrib-types) in the
    title and body of your pull request.
    -   If your contributions span multiple types, please separate them
        into individual pull requests.  Minor patches should be lumped into
        a single pull request.
-   Include a brief description of the rationale, functionality, and
    implementation of your contribution.
-   Include a testing or demo script (named `test_xxx` or
    `demo_xxx`) that can be used to illustrate and validate your
    contribution.  Include a brief description of the script in the pull
    request body.
-   [Squash partial commits][github-squash-commit].
-   If applicable, draft some relevant text to be added to or amended in
    the README.  Please include the text in the pull request comments,
    *not* as part of the commit.

We encourage you to open a new issue to discuss any intended contributions
prior to developing or submitting a pull request.

### Code and documentation style


Please try to follow the style conventions in the SG-t-SNE-Π repository when submitting pull requests.  Use [Doxygen][doxygen-documentation] to document functions and scripts.  We generally try to observe the following rules:

-   The code should be clear, stable, and efficient.  Clarity and stability
    take precedence over efficiency and performance.  The code should be
    self-documented if possible (avoid referring to descriptions in
    existing issues or pull requests).
-   Function interface documentation should be comprehensive and follow the
    format of existing functions (e.g., `sgtsnepi`).
-   Function and variable names are in `camelCase`; script names are in
    `snake_case`.  Typically, matrix/array names start with an uppercase
    letter, while scalar/vector/function names start with a lowercase
    letter.
-   All code blocks should be briefly documented.
-   We prefer 2-space indentation (no tabs), operator/operand alignment
    across multiple lines, and 80-column line width.

<!-- It is unlikely that we will do much development for new features, unless -->
